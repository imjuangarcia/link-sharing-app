# Link Sharing Application

A React app I created to share images, screenshots, videos, etc., with clients. Heads up that I don't use this tool anymore, I've moved to Cloudapp for this, so this repo isn't maintained anymore, but feel free to use it yourself if you like! You'll need to configure Digital Ocean spaces, AWS S3 or similar to get it to work properly.

## Installation and running the app

1. `git clone https://github.com/imjuangarcia/link-sharing-app/`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`
